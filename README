=== About Matlube ===

Scala wrapper for Matrix libraries.

The plan is to create a Matlab-like linear algebra DSL for Scala. This library only supports dense double matrices.I've written the a first cut at a core library and am working on two back-ends: one for Jama (http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/) and another for EJML (http://code.google.com/p/efficient-java-matrix-library/). Why have different back-ends? Well, everyone has thier favorite Matrix library. Different back-ends allows Matlube to easily integrate with whatever your prefered library is. Currently the Jama implementation is useable. I'm still working on the EJML one. Once these two are created, folks can use them as examples for wrapping other Matrix libraries in Matlube.

=== Teaser code using Jama as a backend ===

import matlube.jama._
import matlube.jama.{JMatrix => Mx} // Alias JMatrix to something shorter
// import matlube.ejml.{EMatrix => Mx} // Uncomment this line to use EJML instead of Jama

// Creating Matrices
val a = Mx(2, 2, Array(2, 3, 4, 5)) // 2 x 2 Matrix
val b = Mx(((2D, 3D), (4D, 5D)))    // Same as above
val c = Mx.ones(10, 10)             // 10 x 10 Matrix of ones
val d = Mx.random(5, 5)             // 5 x 5 random values
val e = Mx(4, 3, 5)                 // 4 x 3 matrix filled with the value 5

val ab = a * b // Matrix multiplication
val a5 = 5 * a // we can operate with scalars!
val a6 = a + 6 // scalars can be on either side!

val c15 = c(1, 5)               // Access a value in the matrix
c(1, 5) = 15                    // Set a value in the Matrix
val r = Mx(c(0 to 30 by 3)      // grab elements 0, 3, 6, 9, ... 30 as a Matrix

println(r.asString)  // Display the matrix. Not recommended for BIG matrices


import matlube._

val dr = d(0, ::) // grab the first row as a Matrix
val dc = d(::, 0) // grab the first column as a Matrix
